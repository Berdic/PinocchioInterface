# PinocchioInterface
This is WPF Application which utilizes release of the Pinocchio library and
gives it an interface for easier manipulation.
The full technical description is given in Ilya Baran and Jovan Popovic,
"Automatic Rigging and Animation of 3D Characters," SIGGRAPH 2007.
The source can be found at http://www.mit.edu/~ibaran/autorig/code.html

Source file of the application is inside the Project subfolder. To build the application
you will need preinstalled Microsoft Visual Studio. Application is developed in 
Visual Studio 2015 like a WPF C# project. My recommendation is to install the free community version 
(VS 2015 download link -> https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/),
open the .sln file -> right click on Solution in the Solution Explorer inside VS -> click Rebuild.
Research subfolder contains science work regarding Pinocchio library and the developed Application.
Currently it is on Serbian language.
